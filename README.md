Graphing Calculator

Welcome to my Graphing Calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple tool allows users to graph mathematical equations directly in their browser.
Features

    Graphing: Input mathematical functions and see their corresponding graphs in real time.
    Interactive: Zoom in/out, pan, and adjust graph parameters.
    Basic Functions: Supports basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.


Technologies Used

    HTML: Structure of the web page.
    CSS: Basic styling for the user interface and graphs.
    JavaScript: Graphing logic, user input processing, and rendering of graphs.


Installation

    Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

git clone https://github.com/josefjw/graphing-calculator.git

    Or to simply view the application go to https://josefjw.github.io/Graphing-Calculator/


Usage

    Open the website in a browser.
    Enter a mathematical function in the input box (e.g., x^2).
    Press "Plot" to render the graph of the function.
    Use zoom and pan to adjust the view.


Example Functions

    x^2
    sin(x)
    cos(x)
    tan(x)
    exp(x)
    x^3 + 2x - 5
